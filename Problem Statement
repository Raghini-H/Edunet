Problem Statement:

The objective is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the price of electric vehicles (EVs) using a dataset 
comprising technical specifications and performance metrics. The dataset includes features such as battery capacity (kWh), car model name, 
energy efficiency (Wh/km), fast charging power (kW), driving range per charge (km), top speed (km/h), and acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h (seconds).
By leveraging these features, the model aims to forecast the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for EVs.

This predictive capability supports automotive manufacturers, consumers, and policy makers by providing insights into the factors driving 
EV pricing, enabling informed decision-making in product development, market positioning, and adoption strategies. The project will involve data 
cleaning, feature engineering, encoding categorical variables, and applying regression algorithms to build a robust price prediction model.

Evaluation of the model will be based on standard regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), 
and R-squared to ensure accuracy and reliability.

This approach addresses the growing need for data-driven insights in the electric vehicle market, aiding stakeholders in optimizing pricing strategies 
and accelerating EV adoption.

This problem formulation is aligned with recent research and best practices in EV price prediction using machine learning techniques.
